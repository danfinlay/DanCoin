# DanCoin: A Currency Backed by Dan Finlay

## This is a Draft of a Proposal of a Figment of My Imagination. Nothing in this document has been decided on or implemented, it should be regarded as an extreme fiction, and mental exercise in personal currencies.

Dan pledges to do his very best to serve the holder of a single DanCoin with 15 minutes of his undivided time, to the best of his abilities.

Dan reserves the right to refuse particular uses of his time, and even holds the right to demolish a holder’s coins for no reason for use in extreme circumstances, which he pledges to do as infrequently as possible, always with a public explanation, although reserving the right to withhold details that he deems would be damaging.

If a DanCoin holder desires Dan to commute to a location, the time of that commute costs DanCoins, as do the expenses of the means of transportation, as well as any expenses required to accomplish the desired service, to be invoiced at the average rate DanCoin were sold for over the previous week on a public exchange whose location and existence Dan will make public to the best of his abilities.

When Dan is given a DanCoin, it is immediately destroyed. Dan may create new DanCoins once a week, and cannot issue more than 40 hours worth in a week’s time (160 15-minute coins). This limit is held in human terms, and must be enforced by Arbitration (borrowing sections 13, 13.1, and 13.2 from the MetaMask User Agreement).

Once Dan has commuted to a location, he can relax at his discretion, and DanCoins will not be required for this time.

This contract is intended to always remain under Dan’s control, and if for some reason he should lose control of it, he will instantiate a new DanCoin, and restore all holder balances at the fairest state he can determine.

If Dan is found guilty of minting more than the agreed limits, he will be liable to the DanCoin holders for the values of the illegitimately minted coins at the times of their sales. He will be liable to DanCoin holders proportional to their holdings.
